# Customer Lifetime Value Predictor

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the total income a business can expect from a customer over the entire period of their relationship. Itâ€™s an important metric as it costs less to keep existing customers than it does to acquire new ones, so increasing the value of your existing customers is a great way to drive growth.
